- Set measurable learning objectives

### **R**esearch
- Use ARM documentation as your primary source
- Leverage your LLM research assistant for guidance
- Explore related concepts and connections

### **E**xperiment
- Write code to test your understanding
- Modify examples to see how changes affect behavior
- Create variations to explore edge cases

### **A**nalyze
- Examine results systematically
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Compare actual vs. expected outcomes

### **M**aster
- Synthesize understanding across concepts
- Apply knowledge to new situations
- Teach concepts to solidify learning

## ü§ñ Setting Up Your LLM Research Assistant

### Recommended LLM Tools
- **GitHub Copilot Chat** (VS Code integration)
- **Cursor** (AI-powered IDE)
- **Claude** (Web interface or API)
- **ChatGPT** (Web interface or API)

### Initial LLM Setup
1. **Load Course Context**:
   ```
   Please read this course context: [paste llm-integration/course-context.md]
   
   I'm beginning the ARM AArch64 Assembly Language University course. 
   Act as my research assistant, helping me discover concepts rather 
   than providing direct solutions.
   ```

2. **Establish Research Mode**:
   ```
   For this learning session:
   - Guide me to discover answers through research and exploration
   - Ask clarifying questions to deepen my understanding
   - Point me to relevant ARM manual sections
   - Help me debug systematically using the DREAM methodology
   - Encourage experimentation and hypothesis testing
   ```

### Effective LLM Interaction Examples

**‚úÖ Good Research Questions:**
- "Can you guide me through ARM manual section B1.2 to understand register organization?"
- "Help me develop a systematic approach to analyze this assembly code"
- "What questions should I ask myself about ARM calling conventions?"

**‚ùå Avoid Solution-Seeking:**
- "What's the answer to exercise 1.1?"
- "Write this code for me"
- "Fix my program"
