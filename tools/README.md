./testing/validate-student-work.sh

# Check repository integrity
./git-workflow/repository-integrity-check.sh
```

### Build an Exercise
```bash
# Build single exercise
./build/build-exercise.sh modules/m1-foundation/exercises/1.1-hello-beginner.s

# Build all exercises in a module
./build/build-module.sh m1-foundation
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Test single exercise
./testing/test-exercise.sh 1.1-hello-beginner

# Test entire module
./testing/test-module.sh m1-foundation
```

### Debug Program
```bash
# Launch debugger for exercise
./debugging/debug-exercise.sh hello

# Analyze memory usage
./debugging/memory-analysis.sh hello
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- ARM AArch64 cross-compilation toolchain
- QEMU user-mode emulation
- Basic shell environment (bash/PowerShell)

### Recommended Tools
- GDB with ARM support
- Hex editor for binary analysis
- Performance profiling tools
- Text editor with assembly syntax highlighting

## üìö Documentation

Each tool directory contains:
- **README.md** - Tool-specific documentation
- **examples/** - Usage examples and tutorials
- **config/** - Configuration files and templates

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Toolchain not found**: Verify PATH configuration
2. **Permission errors**: Check script execution permissions
3. **QEMU failures**: Ensure user-mode emulation is installed
4. **Build errors**: Verify toolchain compatibility

### Getting Help
- Check tool-specific README files
- Review setup verification output
- Consult platform-specific setup guides
- Use LLM research assistant for debugging guidance
