# Module 5: Control Flow & Structure - Exercise Files

This directory contains the base exercise files for Module 5. These files provide guided learning experiences for control flow and program structure.

## 🎯 Module 5 Focus

These exercises guide you through:
- **Branching and jumping** instructions
- **Loop implementations** and optimization
- **Conditional execution** and predication
- **Function calls** and calling conventions

## 🔒 Course Content Zone

**Important**: These files are part of the **Course Content Zone**:
- ❌ **Do NOT modify** these files directly
- ✅ **Copy to your student-work directory** before editing

## 🚀 How to Use These Exercises

```bash
# Navigate to your student workspace
cd modules/m5-control-flow-structure/student-work/exercises/

# Copy and work on exercise files
cp ../../exercises/5.1-branches-beginner.s 5.1-my-solution.s
```

## 📚 Key Learning Areas

- **Control Flow** - Branches, jumps, and conditional execution
- **Loop Patterns** - For loops, while loops, and optimizations
- **Function Design** - Calling conventions and parameter passing
- **Program Structure** - Modular design and code organization
