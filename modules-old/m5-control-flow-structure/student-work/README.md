# Student Work Directory - Module 1: Foundation & Setup

This directory is for your personal solutions, experiments, and projects related to Module 1.

## Directory Structure

- **exercises/**: Your solutions to module exercises
- **projects/**: Personal projects and extended implementations
- **experiments/**: Code experiments and learning explorations

## Guidelines

- This directory is **student-owned** - your changes will be preserved during course updates
- Feel free to organize your work as you prefer
- Consider using descriptive filenames for your solutions
- Document your learning process and insights

## Git Workflow

- Your work in this directory will not conflict with course updates
- Changes here are automatically backed up to your backup branches
- This directory is ignored by upstream merges

## Guided Exercise Solutions

When working with guided exercises, follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Copy Guided Exercise
```bash
# Copy the guided exercise file to your workspace
cp ../../exercises/1.1-hello-beginner.s 1.1-hello-my-solution.s
```

### Step 2: Follow DREAM Methodology
- **üéØ DEFINE**: Read learning objectives and problem statement
- **üîç RESEARCH**: Study referenced ARM manual sections
- **‚ö° EXPERIMENT**: Follow step-by-step implementation guidance
- **üìä ANALYZE**: Answer analysis questions about your solution
- **üéì MASTER**: Complete mastery tasks

### Step 3: Implement Your Solution
- Write 100% of code yourself (no boilerplate provided)
- Use guidance comments for direction, not solutions
- Test at each checkpoint mentioned in the exercise

### Naming Convention:
- `1.1-hello-my-solution.s` - Your solution following guided exercise
- `1.3-arithmetic-alternative-approach.s` - Alternative implementation
- `experiment-register-usage.s` - Personal experiments beyond exercises

## Tips

- Use meaningful commit messages for your work
- Experiment freely - this is your learning space
- Keep notes about what you learn from each exercise
- Try different approaches to the same problem
- Document any debugging insights

## Module 1 Specific Notes

For Foundation & Setup module, focus on:
- Understanding the development workflow
- Experimenting with basic assembly syntax
- Testing different toolchain configurations
- Building confidence with the ARM manual

Remember: This is your personal learning space - make it work for you!
