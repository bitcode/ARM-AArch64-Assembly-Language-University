# Module 4: Memory & Data Structures - Exercise Files

This directory contains the base exercise files for Module 4. These files provide guided learning experiences for memory management and data structure implementation.

## 🎯 Module 4 Focus

These exercises guide you through:
- **Memory addressing modes** and pointer arithmetic
- **Data structure implementation** in assembly
- **Stack operations** and frame management
- **Dynamic memory concepts** and allocation patterns

## 🔒 Course Content Zone

**Important**: These files are part of the **Course Content Zone**:
- ❌ **Do NOT modify** these files directly
- ✅ **Copy to your student-work directory** before editing

## 🚀 How to Use These Exercises

```bash
# Navigate to your student workspace
cd modules/m4-memory-data-structures/student-work/exercises/

# Copy and work on exercise files
cp ../../exercises/4.1-pointers-beginner.s 4.1-my-solution.s
```

## 📚 Key Learning Areas

- **Memory Models** - Understanding ARM's memory architecture
