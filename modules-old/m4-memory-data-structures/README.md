- **Multiple Operations**: LDP, STP for pair operations
- **Exclusive Operations**: LDXR, STXR for atomic operations

### Addressing Modes
- **Immediate Offset**: [base, #offset] addressing
- **Register Offset**: [base, register] addressing
- **Pre-indexing**: [base, #offset]! with writeback
- **Post-indexing**: [base], #offset with writeback
- **Scaled Register**: [base, register, LSL #scale] addressing

### Data Structures
- **Arrays**: Contiguous memory layout and indexing
- **Structures**: Field alignment and padding
- **Linked Lists**: Pointer manipulation and traversal

### Memory Alignment
- **Natural Alignment**: Aligning data to its size
- **Padding Requirements**: Structure member alignment
- **Performance Impact**: Aligned vs unaligned access
- **Compiler Directives**: .align and .balign usage
