### Component 3: Research Competency Assessment (25%)

**Format**: DREAM methodology application  
**Time**: 60 minutes  
**Method**: Systematic research and problem-solving

#### Research Challenge
You encounter an ARM assembly program that uses unfamiliar instructions and concepts. Using the DREAM methodology:

1. **Define** (5 points): Clearly articulate what you need to understand
2. **Research** (10 points): Use ARM manual and LLM guidance to investigate
3. **Experiment** (5 points): Create test programs to verify understanding
4. **Analyze** (3 points): Draw conclusions from your experiments
5. **Master** (2 points): Demonstrate ability to explain and apply concepts

**Provided Code Snippet**:
```assembly
.section .data
    values: .word 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
    count: .word 5

.section .text
    .global _start

_start:
    ldr x0, =values
    ldr w1, count
    mov x2, #0
    mov x3, #0

loop:
    cmp w1, #0
    b.le done
    ldr w4, [x0, x2, lsl #2]
    add x3, x3, x4
    add x2, x2, #1
    sub w1, w1, #1
    b loop

done:
    mov x8, #93
    mov x0, x3
    svc #0
```

**Research Tasks**:
- Identify and explain each instruction used
- Describe the algorithm implemented
- Research the addressing mode used in the load instruction
- Explain the purpose of the LSL operation
