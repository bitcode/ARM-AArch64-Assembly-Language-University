# Guided Exercise System Integration Test Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive testing plan for verifying that the guided exercise system integrates correctly with the existing Git workflow.

## 🎯 Test Objectives

Verify that the guided exercise system:
1. **Works with existing Git workflow tools**
2. **Maintains course content protection**
3. **Preserves student workspace integrity**
4. **Integrates with validation systems**
5. **Supports backup and restore operations**
6. **Handles course updates correctly**

## 📋 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Initial Setup and Validation
**Objective**: Verify guided exercises work with student workspace initialization

**Test Steps**:
1. Initialize student workspace
2. Verify guided exercise files are accessible
3. Test copying guided exercises to student workspace
4. Validate directory structure integrity

**Expected Results**:
- Student workspace contains guided exercise directories
- Guided exercise files are read-only in course content zone
- Student can copy exercises to workspace
- Validation passes without errors

### Scenario 2: Student Workflow Integration
**Objective**: Test complete student workflow with guided exercises

**Test Steps**:
1. Copy guided exercise to student workspace
2. Modify student copy (simulate student work)
3. Commit changes to personal-work branch
4. Run validation checks
5. Create backup

**Expected Results**:
- Student can copy and modify exercises freely
- Original guided exercises remain unchanged
- Validation recognizes student work as valid
- Backup includes student exercise solutions

### Scenario 3: Course Update Integration
**Objective**: Verify guided exercises work with semester updates

**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate course update with new guided exercises
2. Run semester update process
3. Verify new exercises appear in course content zone
4. Confirm student work is preserved
5. Test access to new guided exercises

**Expected Results**:
- New guided exercises added to course content zone
- Existing student work remains untouched
- Student can access and copy new exercises
- No conflicts with student workspace

### Scenario 4: Backup and Restore Operations
**Objective**: Test backup system with guided exercise student work

**Test Steps**:
1. Create student solutions for multiple guided exercises
2. Create manual backup
3. Modify student solutions
4. Restore from backup
5. Verify guided exercise solutions are restored correctly

**Expected Results**:
- Backup includes all student exercise solutions
- Restore operation preserves student work structure
- Guided exercise files remain in course content zone
- No data loss during backup/restore cycle

### Scenario 5: Conflict Resolution
**Objective**: Test conflict resolution with guided exercise modifications

**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate conflict scenario (unlikely but possible)
2. Run conflict resolution tools
3. Verify guided exercises are handled correctly
4. Confirm student work protection

**Expected Results**:
- Conflict resolution preserves course content zone
- Student workspace remains protected
- Guided exercises maintain integrity
- Resolution follows documented rules

### Scenario 6: Validation System Integration
**Objective**: Verify validation works with guided exercise structure

**Test Steps**:
1. Run full validation on repository with guided exercises
2. Test validation with student exercise solutions
3. Verify validation catches unauthorized modifications
4. Test quick validation mode

**Expected Results**:
- Validation recognizes guided exercise structure
- Student solutions pass validation checks
- Unauthorized course content changes are detected
- Quick validation works efficiently

## 🔧 Test Implementation

### Test Environment Setup
```bash
# Create test environment
mkdir -p test-environment
cd test-environment

# Clone repository for testing
git clone [repository-url] guided-exercise-test
cd guided-exercise-test

# Initialize student workspace
./tools/setup/student-workspace-init.sh
```

### Test Execution Commands

#### Scenario 1: Initial Setup
```bash
# Test workspace initialization
./tools/testing/validate-student-work.sh --full

# Verify guided exercise structure
ls -la modules/*/exercises/
ls -la modules/*/student-work/exercises/

# Test exercise copying
cd modules/m1-foundation/student-work/exercises/
cp ../../exercises/1.1-hello-beginner.s 1.1-hello-test-solution.s
```

#### Scenario 2: Student Workflow
```bash
# Simulate student work
echo "// Test modification" >> 1.1-hello-test-solution.s

# Commit changes
git add 1.1-hello-test-solution.s
git commit -m "Test: Add guided exercise solution"

# Validate
./tools/testing/validate-student-work.sh

# Create backup
./tools/git-workflow/backup-manager.sh --create "test-exercise-work"
```

#### Scenario 3: Course Updates
```bash
# Check for updates
./tools/git-workflow/semester-update.sh --check

# Simulate update (if available)
./tools/git-workflow/semester-update.sh --interactive
```

#### Scenario 4: Backup Operations
```bash
# List backups
./tools/git-workflow/backup-manager.sh --list

# Test restore
./tools/git-workflow/backup-manager.sh --restore [backup-name]
```

#### Scenario 5: Conflict Resolution
```bash
# Test conflict resolution (if conflicts exist)
./tools/git-workflow/resolve-conflicts.sh --analyze
```

#### Scenario 6: Validation
```bash
# Full validation
./tools/testing/validate-student-work.sh --full

# Quick validation
./tools/testing/validate-student-work.sh --quick
```

- ✅ Course content zone protection preserved
- ✅ Guided exercises accessible and copyable
- ✅ Validation passes appropriately
- ✅ No data loss or corruption

## 🚨 Known Considerations

### Expected Behaviors
1. **Course Content Protection**: Guided exercises should be read-only
2. **Student Workspace Freedom**: Students can modify their copies freely
3. **Validation Intelligence**: System should recognize guided exercise structure
4. **Backup Completeness**: All student work should be backed up
5. **Update Safety**: Course updates should not affect student work

### Potential Issues to Watch For
1. **Permission Problems**: Guided exercises becoming writable
2. **Validation Errors**: False positives on guided exercise structure
3. **Backup Gaps**: Student exercise solutions not included in backups
4. **Update Conflicts**: Course updates affecting student workspace
5. **Path Issues**: Incorrect file paths in guided exercise references

## 📈 Test Automation

### Automated Test Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# File: test-guided-exercise-integration.sh

set -e

echo "🧪 Starting Guided Exercise Integration Tests"

# Test 1: Workspace validation
echo "Test 1: Workspace Validation"
./tools/testing/validate-student-work.sh --quick

# Test 2: Exercise copying
echo "Test 2: Exercise Copying"
cd modules/m1-foundation/student-work/exercises/
cp ../../exercises/1.1-hello-beginner.s test-copy.s
echo "// Test modification" >> test-copy.s

# Test 3: Commit and validate
echo "Test 3: Commit and Validate"
git add test-copy.s
git commit -m "Test: Guided exercise integration"
cd ../../../..
./tools/testing/validate-student-work.sh --quick

# Test 4: Backup creation
echo "Test 4: Backup Creation"
./tools/git-workflow/backup-manager.sh --create "integration-test"

echo "✅ All integration tests completed successfully"
```
