# Guided Exercise System Guide
## ARM AArch64 Assembly Language University Course

**Complete guide to using the guided exercise system for effective ARM assembly learning**

## 🎯 What Are Guided Exercises?

Guided exercises are specially designed learning files that provide **structured guidance while maintaining your independence**. They balance giving you clear direction with ensuring you write all code yourself.

### Key Features
- **🎯 Clear Learning Objectives** - Know exactly what you're learning
- **🧠 DREAM Methodology Integration** - Systematic learning approach
- **📚 ARM Manual References** - Direct links to authoritative documentation
- **💡 Step-by-Step Guidance** - Clear instructions without solutions
- **🚫 No Boilerplate Code** - You implement everything from scratch

## 📋 How Guided Exercises Work

### The Philosophy
Guided exercises solve a common problem in assembly language learning:
- **❌ Starting from scratch** can be overwhelming and directionless
- **❌ Copy-paste tutorials** don't build real understanding
- **✅ Guided discovery** provides direction while building independence

### What You Get
Each guided exercise provides:
1. **Learning objectives** - Clear goals for the exercise
2. **ARM manual references** - Specific sections to study
3. **DREAM methodology structure** - Systematic learning approach
4. **Step-by-step guidance** - Implementation direction
5. **Analysis questions** - Understanding verification
6. **Mastery tasks** - Knowledge application

### What You Don't Get
- **No starter code** - You write everything yourself
- **No solutions** - Hints guide you to discover answers
- **No shortcuts** - Full learning process required

## 🧠 DREAM Methodology Integration

Every guided exercise follows the DREAM methodology:

### 🎯 DEFINE Phase

- Look up unfamiliar concepts
- Take notes on key ideas
- Ask yourself: "What do I need to know to solve this?"

#### ⚡ EXPERIMENT Phase
- Follow the step-by-step implementation guidance
- Write code incrementally
- Test at each checkpoint
- Ask yourself: "How can I apply what I've learned?"

#### 📊 ANALYZE Phase
- Examine your results carefully
- Answer the analysis questions
- Compare with expected behavior
- Ask yourself: "What do my results tell me?"

#### 🎓 MASTER Phase
- Complete the mastery tasks
- Try variations and extensions
- Explain concepts to someone else
- Ask yourself: "How can I apply this knowledge?"

### Step 4: Test and Validate
```bash
# Build your solution
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc -static 1.1-hello-my-solution.s -o hello

# Test your solution
qemu-aarch64-static ./hello

# Verify expected behavior
echo $?  # Check exit code
```

### Step 5: Document Your Learning
```bash
# Add notes about your insights
echo "## Exercise 1.1 Insights" >> exercise-notes.md
echo "- Learned about system calls..." >> exercise-notes.md
echo "- Key insight: ..." >> exercise-notes.md
```
