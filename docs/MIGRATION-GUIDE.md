# Migration Guide: Complex to Simple Git Workflow
## ARM Assembly Language University Course

This guide helps existing users migrate from the complex dual-zone Git workflow to the new simplified fork-and-branch workflow.

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (Complex System)
- 859-line Git workflow documentation
- Dual-zone directory structure with complex rules
- Multiple backup automation scripts
- Complex conflict resolution system
- Semester update scripts with extensive validation

### After (Simplified System)
- 50-line simple Git workflow guide
- Standard fork-and-branch workflow
- Simple `update-course.sh` script
- Streamlined module structure (`m1/`, `m2/`, etc.)
- Focus on learning, not Git complexity

## 🔄 Migration Steps

### Step 1: Backup Your Current Work
```bash
# Create a backup branch of your current state
git checkout personal-work  # or whatever branch you're on
git branch migration-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git push origin migration-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Step 2: Run the New Setup
```bash
# The new setup script handles migration automatically
./setup.sh
```

This will:
- Configure simplified Git workflow
- Migrate to new module structure
- Preserve your student work
- Set up the new `my-work` branch

### Step 3: Verify Your Work is Preserved
```bash
# Check that your student work is still there
ls modules/m1/student-work/
ls modules/m2/student-work/
# etc.

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch --show-current  # Should show "my-work"
```

### Step 4: Update Your Workflow

#### Old Commands → New Commands
```bash
# OLD: Complex update process
./tools/git-workflow/semester-update.sh --interactive

# NEW: Simple update
./update-course.sh

# OLD: Complex backup management
./tools/git-workflow/backup-manager.sh --create "description"

# NEW: Standard Git
git add .
git commit -m "Save my work"
git push origin my-work

# OLD: Complex validation
./tools/testing/validate-student-work.sh

# NEW: Standard Git status
git status
```

## 📁 Directory Structure Changes

### Old Structure
```
modules/
├── m1-foundation/
│   ├── exercises/           # Course content
│   ├── student-work/        # Your work
│   └── personal-notes/      # Your notes
└── m2-data-registers/
    ├── exercises/
    ├── student-work/
    └── personal-notes/
```

### New Structure
```
modules/
├── m1/
│   ├── exercises/           # Course content
│   ├── student-work/        # Your work
│   └── personal-notes/      # Your notes
└── m2/
    ├── exercises/
    ├── student-work/
    └── personal-notes/
```

**Your student work is automatically migrated to the new structure.**

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Migration Issues

### Issue: "My student work is missing"
**Solution**: Check the migration backup
```bash
git checkout migration-backup-YYYYMMDD
# Copy your work manually if needed
cp -r modules/m1-foundation/student-work/* modules/m1/student-work/
git checkout my-work
git add .
git commit -m "Restore student work"
```

### Issue: "Git conflicts during migration"
**Solution**: Use the new update script
```bash
./update-course.sh
# Follow the conflict resolution guidance provided
```

### Issue: "Old tools still referenced"
**Solution**: Update your bookmarks and scripts
- Old tools are archived in `docs/tools/git-workflow-archive/`
- Use `./update-course.sh` instead of old update scripts
- Use standard Git commands for daily work

## 📚 Updated Documentation

### New Student Resources
- **[Simple Git Workflow](docs/student/STUDENT-GIT-WORKFLOW.md)** - 50-line guide
- **[Quick Reference](docs/student/STUDENT-QUICK-REFERENCE.md)** - Essential commands
- **[Troubleshooting](docs/student/STUDENT-TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** - Common issues

### Archived Resources
- Complex Git tools: `docs/tools/git-workflow-archive/`
- Old documentation preserved for reference

## 🎯 Benefits of the New System

### For Students
- **Faster setup**: Fork → setup → coding in under 15 minutes
- **Standard Git**: Learn industry-standard workflow
- **Less complexity**: Focus on ARM assembly, not Git
- **Easier updates**: Simple `./update-course.sh` command

### For Instructors
- **Easier support**: Standard Git troubleshooting
- **Reduced complexity**: Fewer moving parts
- **Better adoption**: Students familiar with fork-and-branch
- **Maintainable**: Standard Git practices

## 🆘 Need Help?

1. **Check your migration backup**: `git branch -a | grep migration-backup`
2. **Run the new setup**: `./setup.sh` (safe to run multiple times)
3. **Use the new update script**: `./update-course.sh --help`
4. **Ask for help**: GitHub Discussions with "migration" tag
