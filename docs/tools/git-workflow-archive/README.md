# Archived Git Workflow Tools

This directory contains the complex Git workflow tools that were replaced in Phase 3 of the course redesign.

## What Was Archived

- **backup-manager.sh** - Complex backup system with dual-zone management
- **semester-update.sh** - 859-line complex update system
- **resolve-conflicts.sh** - Automated conflict resolution system
- **repository-integrity-check.sh** - Repository health checking
- **workflow-config.yaml** - Complex workflow configuration

## Why These Were Archived

The course redesign simplified the Git workflow from a complex dual-zone system to a standard fork-and-branch workflow:

- **Before**: 859-line Git guide, dual-zone directories, complex backup automation
- **After**: 50-line simple guide, standard Git workflow, simple update script

## Migration to Simplified System

Students now use:
- **setup.sh** - Configures simple fork-and-branch workflow
- **update-course.sh** - Simple course update script
- Standard Git commands for daily work

## For Instructors

These archived tools can be referenced for:
- Understanding the previous complex system
- Migrating existing student repositories
- Advanced Git workflow research

The new simplified system achieves the same goals (protecting student work, enabling course updates) with much less complexity.
