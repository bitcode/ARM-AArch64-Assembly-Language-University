# LLM Integration System

This directory contains files and prompts designed to optimize your learning experience with Large Language Model (LLM) research assistants integrated into your IDE (GitHub Copilot Chat, Cursor, Claude, etc.).

## üéØ Philosophy: LLM as Research Assistant

The LLM serves as your **research partner**, not a solution provider. This approach:
- Encourages deep understanding over quick answers
- Develops critical thinking and problem-solving skills
- Builds confidence in navigating technical documentation
- Prepares you for real-world development scenarios

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Load Course Context
Before starting any module, load the course context into your LLM chat:

```
Please read and understand this course context: [paste course-context.md]

I'm beginning the ARM AArch64 Assembly Language University course. Act as my research assistant, helping me discover concepts rather than providing direct solutions.
```

### 2. Set Learning Mode
Establish the research assistant role:

```
For this learning session:
- Guide me to discover answers through research and exploration
- Ask clarifying questions to deepen my understanding
- Point me to relevant ARM manual sections
- Help me debug systematically using the DREAM methodology
- Encourage experimentation and hypothesis testing
```

### 3. Module-Specific Context
When starting a new module, provide module context:

```
I'm starting Module [X]: [Module Name]. Here's the module context: [paste module README]

Help me understand the learning objectives and guide my exploration of the key concepts.
```

## üî¨ DREAM Methodology

**D**efine the problem clearly  
**R**esearch relevant documentation  
**E**xperiment with potential solutions  
**A**nalyze results and patterns  
**M**aster the underlying concepts  

### Example DREAM Application

**Problem**: Understanding ARM register usage in function calls

**Define**: "I need to understand how ARM AArch64 uses registers for function parameters and return values"

**Research**: "Can you guide me to the relevant ARM manual sections about calling conventions?"

**Experiment**: "Let me write a simple function and analyze the register usage"

**Analyze**: "What patterns do I see in how registers are allocated?"

**Master**: "How does this compare to other architectures I know?"

## üìö Effective Research Questions

### Architecture Understanding
```
Can you help me understand [specific ARM concept] by guiding me through the relevant ARM manual sections? I want to discover the answer through research rather than having it explained directly.
```

### Code Analysis
```
I have this ARM assembly code: [code]. Instead of explaining what it does, can you help me develop a systematic approach to analyze it myself?
```

### Debugging Assistance
```
My ARM assembly program isn't working as expected: [describe issue]. Can you guide me through a debugging methodology rather than identifying the problem directly?
```

### Concept Exploration
```
I'm learning about [topic] in ARM assembly. What questions should I be asking myself to develop a deep understanding of this concept?
```

## üõ†Ô∏è IDE Integration Tips

### GitHub Copilot Chat
- Use `@workspace` to include course files in context
- Reference specific files with `#file:path/to/file`
- Use `/explain` for guided exploration of concepts

### Cursor
- Use `@codebase` to reference course materials
- Leverage the composer for multi-file context
- Use `@docs` to reference ARM documentation

### Claude/ChatGPT
- Copy-paste relevant context files at session start
- Use conversation memory for ongoing learning sessions
- Reference specific exercise files and manual sections

## üéØ Learning Objectives Integration

Each exercise includes LLM-ready prompts:

```yaml
research_prompts:
  - "Explain ARM AArch64 program sections and their purposes"
  - "Compare ARM system calls to x86-64 system calls"
  - "Describe the role of registers in ARM function calls"
```

Use these prompts to:
1. Start focused research sessions
2. Explore concepts systematically
3. Connect new learning to prior knowledge
4. Develop comprehensive understanding

## üìä Progress Tracking with LLM

### Weekly Reflection Prompts
```
I've completed Week [X] of the ARM assembly course. Can you help me:
1. Identify key concepts I've learned
2. Recognize areas needing more exploration
3. Connect this week's learning to previous modules
4. Prepare questions for next week's topics
```

### Concept Mastery Assessment
```
Test my understanding of [concept] by asking me probing questions that reveal gaps in my knowledge. Guide me to discover these gaps through Socratic questioning.
```

## üîÑ Iterative Learning Process

1. **Explore**: Use LLM to guide initial concept exploration
2. **Practice**: Apply concepts in exercises with LLM debugging support
3. **Reflect**: Discuss learning with LLM to identify gaps
4. **Research**: Dive deeper into ARM documentation with LLM guidance
5. **Synthesize**: Connect concepts across modules with LLM facilitation

## üö´ What NOT to Ask Your LLM

Avoid these solution-seeking approaches:
- "What's the answer to exercise X?"
- "Write the code for me"
- "Fix my program"
- "Tell me what this code does"

## ‚úÖ What TO Ask Your LLM

Embrace these research-oriented approaches:
- "Guide me through analyzing this code"
- "What ARM manual sections should I explore?"
- "Help me develop a debugging strategy"
- "What questions should I ask about this concept?"
