# Guided Exercise Template Creation Guide

This guide explains how to create guided exercise files using the template system for the ARM AArch64 Assembly Language University course.

## üéØ Template Philosophy

The guided exercise templates balance **guidance** with **student self-reliance**:
- **Provide clear direction** without giving away solutions
- **Integrate DREAM methodology** for systematic learning
- **Scale guidance level** based on difficulty
- **Maintain educational value** of writing code from scratch

## üìÅ Template Files

### Available Templates

1. **`guided-exercise-template.s`** - Master template with all placeholders
2. **`beginner-exercise-template.s`** - Extensive guidance for newcomers
3. **`intermediate-exercise-template.s`** - Moderate guidance for developing skills
4. **`advanced-exercise-template.s`** - Minimal guidance for complex challenges
5. **`expert-exercise-template.s`** - Research-level open-ended challenges

### Template Selection Guide

| Difficulty | Guidance Level | Target Audience | Time Investment |

4. **Customize content**: Adapt DREAM methodology and guidance
5. **Validate**: Check against validation checklist
6. **Test**: Verify exercise works as intended

### Example: Creating a Beginner Exercise

```bash
# Copy template
cp templates/beginner-exercise-template.s modules/m1-foundation/exercises/1.1-hello-beginner.s

# Edit the file and replace:
[MODULE] ‚Üí 1
[LESSON] ‚Üí 1
[TOPIC] ‚Üí hello
[DIFFICULTY] ‚Üí beginner
[MODULE_NAME] ‚Üí Foundation & Setup
[EXERCISE_TITLE] ‚Üí Hello World - Your First Assembly Program
# ... and so on
```
