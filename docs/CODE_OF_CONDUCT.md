## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to educational activities, including:
- Course discussions and forums
- Exercise submissions and reviews
- Peer collaboration and study groups
- Community events and workshops
- Mentoring and tutoring relationships

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at conduct@arm-assembly-university.edu. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Reporting Guidelines

When reporting an incident, please include:
- Your contact information
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
- Your account of what occurred, including any relevant context
- Additional context or information that may be helpful
- Whether you believe the incident is ongoing

### Response Process

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been unfairly sanctioned under this Code of Conduct, you may appeal the decision by contacting the community leaders with:
- A clear explanation of why you believe the sanction was unfair
- Any additional context or information relevant to your case
- A commitment to upholding community standards going forward

Appeals will be reviewed by community leaders not involved in the original enforcement decision.

## Educational Considerations

### Learning-Focused Enforcement

Our enforcement approach prioritizes educational outcomes:
- **Teaching Moments:** Minor violations may be addressed through education rather than punishment
- **Skill Development:** We help community members develop better communication and collaboration skills
- **Restorative Justice:** We focus on repairing harm and rebuilding community relationships
- **Growth Mindset:** We believe people can learn from mistakes and improve their behavior

### Academic Integrity

Special considerations for educational misconduct:
- **First Offenses:** May result in educational interventions and additional learning opportunities
- **Repeated Violations:** May result in removal from specific courses or community privileges
- **Severe Cases:** May result in permanent exclusion from the educational community
