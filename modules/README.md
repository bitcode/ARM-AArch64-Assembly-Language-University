# ARM Assembly Course - Redesigned Modules

This directory contains the **Phase 2 redesigned modules** with simplified structure and streamlined exercises.

## 🎯 Design Goals Achieved

✅ **Simplified Structure**: Flattened from complex dual-zone to single `exercises/` per module  
✅ **Streamlined Exercises**: Reduced from 191+ lines to ~30 lines maximum  
✅ **Clear Visual Markers**: ★ START HERE ★ with ASCII art borders  
✅ **Essential Guidance Only**: Removed extensive boilerplate and YAML metadata  
✅ **Copy-and-Edit Workflow**: `cp hello.s my-hello.s` for immediate coding  

## 📁 New Module Structure

```
m1/                    # Foundation (was m1-foundation)
├── README.md         # Brief overview (~35 lines)
└── exercises/
    ├── hello.s       # Hello world (~30 lines)
    ├── registers.s   # Register manipulation
    └── arithmetic.s  # Basic math operations

m2/                    # Data & Registers (was m2-data-registers)
├── README.md
└── exercises/
    ├── data-types.s  # Working with different data types
    └── addressing.s  # Memory addressing modes

m3/ through m8/        # Progressive complexity
├── README.md         # Learning objectives & key concepts
└── exercises/
    └── [topic].s     # Focused, streamlined exercises
```

## 🚀 Student Workflow

1. **Copy**: `cp m1/exercises/hello.s my-hello.s`
2. **Edit**: Find ★ START HERE ★ marker and code
3. **Build**: `../build.sh my-hello.s`
4. **Run**: `qemu-aarch64-static ./my-hello`

## 📊 Improvements Summary

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Exercise Length | 191+ lines | ~30 lines |
| Module Names | `m1-foundation` | `m1` |
| Directory Structure | Complex dual-zone | Single `exercises/` |
| Visual Markers | Buried in text | Clear ★ START HERE ★ |
| Cognitive Load | High (extensive guidance) | Low (essential hints) |
| Time to Start Coding | 5-10 minutes reading | Immediate |

## 🎓 Progressive Complexity

- **m1-m2**: Beginner (basic concepts, simple syntax)
- **m3-m4**: Intermediate (control flow, data structures)  
- **m5-m6**: Advanced (functions, SIMD)
- **m7-m8**: Expert (optimization, capstone projects)

## ✅ Success Criteria Met

- [x] Exercise files under 30 lines with clear visual markers
- [x] Simplified module structure (m1/, m2/, etc.)
- [x] Students can immediately start coding after copying files
- [x] Progressive complexity maintained across modules
- [x] All exercises follow consistent template standards
- [x] Removed YAML metadata and complex headers
- [x] Copy-and-edit workflow implemented
