## üíª Programming and Technical Questions

### Q: Why do my programs keep crashing with segmentation faults?

**A:** Segmentation faults are common in assembly programming. Here's how to debug them systematically:

**Common Causes:**
1. **Uninitialized Pointers:**
   ```assembly
   // Dangerous: x1 contains random value
   ldr x0, [x1]
   
   // Safe: Initialize pointer first
   adr x1, data_label
   ldr x0, [x1]
   ```

2. **Stack Corruption:**
   ```assembly
   // Dangerous: Not preserving stack
   sub sp, sp, #8
   // ... forgot to restore sp
   
   // Safe: Balanced stack operations
   sub sp, sp, #16
   // ... use stack
   add sp, sp, #16
   ```

3. **Array Bounds Violations:**
   ```assembly
   // Dangerous: No bounds checking
   ldr x0, [x2, x1, lsl #3]
   
   // Safe: Check bounds first
   cmp x1, #array_size
   bge bounds_error
   ldr x0, [x2, x1, lsl #3]
   ```

**Debugging Strategy:**
1. **Use GDB**: Step through code and examine registers
2. **Add Bounds Checking**: Validate all memory accesses
3. **Initialize Variables**: Ensure all pointers are valid
4. **Check Stack Balance**: Verify push/pop operations match
5. **Start Simple**: Begin with minimal code and add complexity gradually

### Q: How do I know which registers to use for what purpose?

**A:** ARM AArch64 has register usage conventions that guide allocation:

**General Purpose Registers (x0-x30):**
- **x0-x7**: Function arguments and return values
- **x8**: Indirect result location register
- **x9-x15**: Temporary registers (caller-saved)
- **x16-x17**: Intra-procedure-call temporary registers
- **x18**: Platform register (avoid in user code)
- **x19-x28**: Callee-saved registers
- **x29**: Frame pointer (FP)
- **x30**: Link register (LR)

**Special Registers:**
- **SP**: Stack pointer (always use for stack operations)
- **PC**: Program counter (read-only, modified by branches)

**Usage Guidelines:**
1. **Function Parameters**: Use x0-x7 for first 8 parameters
2. **Return Values**: Use x0 (and x1 for 128-bit values)
3. **Temporary Work**: Use x9-x15 for short-term calculations
4. **Preserved Values**: Use x19-x28 for values that must survive function calls
5. **Local Variables**: Allocate on stack, access via SP or FP

**Example:**
```assembly
my_function:
    // x0, x1 contain parameters
    // Save callee-saved registers if used
    stp x19, x20, [sp, #-16]!
    
    // Use x19, x20 for persistent values
    mov x19, x0    // Save parameter
    mov x20, x1    // Save parameter
    
    // Use x9-x15 for temporary calculations
    add x9, x19, x20
    
    // Return result in x0
    mov x0, x9
    
    // Restore callee-saved registers
    ldp x19, x20, [sp], #16
    ret
```

### Q: What's the difference between immediate and register operands?

**A:** ARM instructions can use different types of operands:

**Immediate Operands:**
- Constant values encoded directly in the instruction
- Limited range (typically 12-bit values, sometimes extended)
- Prefixed with `#` symbol

```assembly
mov x0, #42        // Load immediate value 42
add x1, x2, #8     // Add immediate 8 to x2
cmp x0, #100       // Compare x0 with immediate 100
```

**Register Operands:**
- Values stored in registers
- Full 64-bit range available
- No special prefix

```assembly
mov x0, x1         // Copy x1 to x0
add x2, x3, x4     // Add x3 and x4, store in x2
cmp x0, x1         // Compare x0 with x1
```

**Extended Operands:**
- Register values with optional shifts or extensions
- Provide additional flexibility

```assembly
add x0, x1, x2, lsl #2    // Add x1 + (x2 << 2)
ldr x0, [x1, x2, sxtw]    // Load from x1 + sign_extend(w2)
```

**When to Use Each:**
- **Immediate**: For constants, small offsets, loop counters
- **Register**: For variables, computed values, large numbers
- **Extended**: For array indexing, scaled addressing

**Limitations:**
- Immediate values have size restrictions
- Some instructions don't support immediate operands
- Large constants require multiple instructions or literal pools

### Q: How do I handle strings and arrays in ARM assembly?

**A:** Strings and arrays require understanding of memory layout and addressing:

**String Handling:**
```assembly
.section .data
message: .ascii "Hello, World!\n"
msg_len = . - message

.section .text
print_string:
    mov x8, #64        // sys_write
    mov x0, #1         // stdout
    adr x1, message    // string address
    mov x2, #msg_len   // string length
    svc #0             // system call
    ret
```

**Array Operations:**
```assembly
.section .data
numbers: .quad 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
array_size = (. - numbers) / 8

.section .text
sum_array:
    adr x0, numbers    // Array base address
    mov x1, #array_size // Array size
    mov x2, #0         // Sum accumulator
    mov x3, #0         // Index counter
    
loop:
    cmp x3, x1         // Check if done
    beq done
    ldr x4, [x0, x3, lsl #3]  // Load array[index]
    add x2, x2, x4     // Add to sum
    add x3, x3, #1     // Increment index
    b loop
    
done:
    mov x0, x2         // Return sum
    ret
```

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Memory Layout**: Understand how data is stored in memory
2. **Address Calculation**: Use base + offset addressing
3. **Scaling**: Multiply index by element size (8 bytes for .quad)
4. **Bounds Checking**: Always verify array access is within bounds
5. **Null Termination**: C-style strings end with null byte
